The EMERALD Project commenced its journey in October, marked by a dynamic kick-off meeting at the UPF Poblenou Campus in Barcelona.


EMERALD kicked off with a lively meeting hosted at the UPF Poblenou Campus in Barcelona on October 17th. The event was attended by representatives from all seven partners forming the consortium, setting the stage for a promising venture.


During the meeting, each partner presented their plans, outlining key contributions to the project's success over the initial six months. The presentations delved into the specific roles and objectives each partner will undertake. In addition, the Project Officer joined remotely, providing an introduction to the project from the European Commission's side.


The meeting not only served as a platform for strategic planning but also laid the groundwork for seamless cooperation and synergy among the consortium members. As the EMERALD Project takes its first steps, the shared commitment and enthusiasm of the partners promise an exciting journey ahead.
