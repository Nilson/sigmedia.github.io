The Trinity team is now up to full strength as we welcome Julien, Boldo, Vibhoothi and Hareesh (who just joined this month). Boldo is a recent Trinity MAI Graduate working with Francois on colour applications in Emerald. With previous postdoc experience in AI Processor design and verification, Hareesh will join Shreejithâ€™s team on efficient energy aware hardware implementations. Julien and Vibhoothi both have extensive experience working with compressed bistreams as part of VideoLan and will work on optimised compression in Emerald.

Back in Nov 2023 we visited Disguise to better understand their requirements and
kick off our workpackage collaboration. The snap below shows Francois and Julien
being carried away by their first Virtual Set experience (you can see the [clip

Shreejith followed up a few weeks later with a visit to kick off the work on
energy measurement.
