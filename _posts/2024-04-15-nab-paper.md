The Sigmedia team is delighted to report that Vibhoothi, Research Assistant and
PhD student working on Emerald, won the NAB Best Student Paper Award at the 2024
NAB Show. The Best Student Paper Award was presented by Vibhoothi at the “Generative AI Uses and
Video Transcoding” session on Monday, April 15 (see [NAB press coverage](https://nabpilot.org/nab-and-ieeebts-partner-to-present-best-student-paper-award/)).

In this work, we evaluate production-ready encoders for H.264 (x264), H.265
(HEVC), AV1 (SVT-AV1) along with direct comparisons to the latest AV1 encoder
inside NVIDIA GPUs (40 series), and AWS Mediaconvert’s AV1 implementation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the single pass encoding inside modern
encoder implementations can give very good quality at reasonable compute cost,
even for high-end production use cases.



This work is part of the TCD effort within Emerald to show how the use of modern video codecs can effectively reduce bandwidth and energy consumption across the visual media pipeline. 

In the coming months, TCD will be working with Disguise Systems to integrate
some of these key findings into their virtual production workflow.
