Back in June 2024 part of the Trinity team (François and Boldo) visited Filmlight in Munich to present their latest AI tool on colour matching.


The objective of the tool is to partially automate the step of matching the colours between shots of a same scene. This is one of the first steps of the colour grading workflow, and it typically takes several days for an artist to colour match all shots of a single TV series episode. Automating this task could free up considerable time for artists to undertake more creative work.

The visit was an opportunity for the Trinity team to demonstrate their initial results and learn from an experienced colourist the intricacies of scene matching. The team started a discussion with Filmlight on how to measure the production efficiency gains of this AI tools in actual workflows. Next steps are to iterate TCD’s tool on Filmlight platform.
