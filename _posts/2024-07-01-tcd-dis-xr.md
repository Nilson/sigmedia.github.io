Team work makes the dream work! For our collaborations on EMERALD, Disguise and
Trinity College Dublin have been working together on determining what the
optimal compression configuration for Virtual Production and Extended Reality
backdrops might be.

Using data supplied by Disguise, run through compression algorithms at TCD then sent back to Disguise for camera capture on an XR stage, we’ve been working together to come up with a streamlined process to allow for the team at Trinity to analyse.

Over several rounds of sequence capture sessions, Disguise has provided Trinity with a wealth of data that forms the basis of a paper being presented at this year’s SMPTE MTS conference. We can’t wait to see you at the event to show off the results of our hard work!
