# Welcome to the Sigmedia Group website

The Signal Processing Media Applications Group (Sigmedia) is a research group in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. The group was started in 1998 when Prof. Anil Kokaram joined the EEE Department as a lecturer. The group has subsequently expanded and Dr. Naomi Harte joined the group as an SFI Lecturer in 2008, bringing an expertise in speech processing.


## Research

Our research activities are centred on digital signal processing technology. We exploit knowledge from statistics, applied mathematics, computer vision, image and video processing, and speech and language understanding in order to solve very unique problems in a range of domains. There are three main research themes for the group:

  - Digital Cinema and Restoration
  - Information Retrieval
  - Human Speech Communication

We are well known for our work on cinema post-production and our motion estimation technology (in collaboration with The Foundry) is used around the world for film special effects in movies like Matrix, Lord of the Rings, X-Men, Spider Man, Harry Potter and so on. This work was recognised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2007.


## Collaboration

Sigmedia researchers have been involved with many EU projects (i3dpost,MOUMIR, PRESTOSPACE) and have associations with archive houses around Europe. We are currently involved in EU COST Actions IC1106 and IC1105. A number of our current projects are funded by Science Foundation Ireland, IRCSET and Enterprise Ireland. We collaborate closely with Industry, including, Google, DTS, Lightstream Animation and The Foundry. The group has a close association with Prof. Frank Boland's Audio, Acoustics and Music Research Group, with many joint projects.
