RISHABH JAIN received the B.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering
from the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) in 2019, and the M.S. degree in
data analytics from the University of Galway, Ireland in 2020. He received his
Ph.D. degree in Sound Processing and Artificial Intelligence from the University
of Galway under the guidance of Dr. Peter Corcoran in 2024. He is currently
working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin with Dr.
Naomi Harte. His research interests include machine learning and artificial
intelligence, specifically in the domains of speech understanding,
text-to-speech, speaker recognition, automatic speech recognition, and
audio-visual speech recognition.


Rishabh has extensive experience as a Research Assistant at the University of
Galway, where he worked on the DTIF-DAVID Project, a collaboration between
XPERI, SoapBox Labs, and University of Galway funded by Enterprise Ireland (EI).
He also served as a Research Scientist at Oxford Wave Research Ltd, conducting
research on training models in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large
Languae Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages.


His Ph.D. research focused on enhancing child speech technologies in
Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-To-Text (STT), optimizing models for realistic
synthetic child speech, improving child ASR performance, applying data
augmentation techniques, integrating TTS and ASR technologies into interactive
smart toys, and developing facial animation pipelines for synthetic-speaking
children, with a strong emphasis on creating nuanced, ethical applications in
speech technology for children.
