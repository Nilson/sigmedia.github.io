Ayushi Pandey is a PhD student based at Trinity College Dublin, and is part of the D-Real CRT Programme. Her work focuses on Speech Synthesis evaluation. She has an M.A. in Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University, and an M.Phil in Computational Linguistics from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H). For her PhD project, she is exploring features in the acoustics of synthetic speech, that may  contribute to the perception of various attributes in the signal, particularly its naturalness. Her previous work involves studying perception of obstruents in non-native speakers of Hindi, development of bilingual corpora in Hindi-English, and analysing the errors of forced-alignment using code-mixed speech.
