Current positions are always listed on the main TCD webpage at [http://www.tcd.ie/vacancies](http://www.tcd.ie/vacancies).

Prospective PhD candidates should contact us during their final year of study to explore funding
opportunities. We consider applications from candidates with a first class degree (expected) in a
numerate discipline e.g. Electronics, Computer Science or Mathematics. Experience in signal
processing and Matlab is a distinct advantage. Please send a short CV and motivation letter,
including the names of at least 2 referees, to Dr. Naomi Harte nharte[a]tcd.ie.

For postdoctoral positions, these posts will be advertised on the main TCD webpages. It is always
worth contacting us a few months in advance of your potential availability if you believe your
research is a particularly good match to the Lab.

We frequently take on talented interns. See our Research page to get an overview of research in the
group.
